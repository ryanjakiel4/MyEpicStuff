Zelda1-like-world
have 5 min to beat the game
like majora's mask
after 5 min, start back in the same spot, except all progress is saved
meaning all boses beaten, items gotten, doors opened
try to see how many "days" it takes to win
more puzzle focused than fighting focused
boss battles will turn into space missile battles

no keys, just mouse and click so it can be easily translated into a mobile app
