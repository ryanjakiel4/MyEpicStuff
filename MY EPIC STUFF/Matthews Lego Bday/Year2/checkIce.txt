check ice
tec
Sir? you might want to look closer inside.
what is that in there? Almost looks like some sort of lever... maybe the one for my spaceship!
Unlikely, however it is promising that the lever will lift this wall that blocks this portion of train track.
But how can i get past the ice?
The torch from earlier cannot be lit again, but you will need another strong source of heat to thaw this out, sir.
