check tv

it looks like a tv, sir. it also appears to have a cartridge reader built in, along with a game controller attachment.
What is this container next to it?
After examination, this container is programmed to open only when you complete various games on the tv.  If you score high enough on a game, you should type "take prize" to take the container's contents for that game.
Well it sounds like it's time for me to play some games.
You cannot do that yet, sir. There are no game cartridges here. You will need to find them in order to play the games.
Aww.
