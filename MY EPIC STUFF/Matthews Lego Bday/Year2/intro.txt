crash
matthew
...Where are we?
It seems you have crash landed in an unknown area, sir.
Thanks, TEC.  Hope it didn’t take you too long to figure that out.
Don’t worry, sir, it took less than a second.  I am a computer after all.
(I always wish I had programmed in a sense of humor...) Well we better work on getting this back up and running. I can’t be late to pick up my gift from Ryan.
That may take longer than usual, sir. Five parts of your ship were lost in the crash and we cannot leave until we locate them.
What parts?
Your dome windshield, a thruster, a lever, an oxygen hose, and your power source.
Any idea where the parts are?
No sir.
Alright, better get started...what's the deal with the train tracks on this planet, tec?
It appears to me, sir, that the world you crashed on is split between 8 train stations.  You are currently on station 0, and the remaining stations are labeled on the map above.
Okay, i think i got it.  Well no use standing here, i have to find those parts!
Sir, there are a few things you are going to need to know before you begin. There are three key commands you may type to interact with the world. “Check ___” can be used to gain info on objects, but if you type just “Check”, then you will receive general info about the station you are at. “Take ___” and “Use ___ on ___” are two other commands you have to interact with objects on this world as you see fit.
Sounds good, tec.  Let's get moving!
