take prize
matthew
the games on this planet are weird... but anyway let's see what prize i've won!
It just looks like a pile of spare pieces, sir.
That's lame.
Actually, upon further inspection, these pieces can be used to build a heat gun, sir.
Hm. That could be useful. At least it looks cool!
