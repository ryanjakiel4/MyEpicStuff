Sir, that tree looks pretty high... are you sure you can climb it?
Tec, c'mon, of course i can.
Be careful.
Jeez, who does that computer think i am... can't climb a tree... yeah right i'll show him.  Just a few more branches...
That branch looks very unstable, sir.
C'mon, almost there... Got it!... ouch!
You have fallen.
Thanks, tec.
