take train

Allow me, sir.
Tec, how are you gonna move this train onto the track?
Just believe, sir, that someone bigger than us out there will come to our aid and place the train on the track.
Okay? Tec, are you running low on battery?
You created me, sir, you should remember that i run on solar power.
It's just... you're weird.
I am a computer.
(Sigh)
Sir, now that you have a train, you can now move to other stations. To do this, just type "Move to station ___"
So, if i wanted to move to station 1, I would type "move to station 1"?
correct, sir.  Also i have sensed that there are other inhabitants of this world that you may want to interact with.  if so, use the command "talk to guy".
Cool!
