talk to guy
matthew
Hey, what's up?
He doesn't seem to speak your language, sir, allow me to translate.
...
He says that he is willing to give up his fire extinguisher for a gold coin, and he will trade you his magnet for one gold brick.
Where am I going to get those?
I do not know, sir. May i suggest searching around? Also, the man mentioned that you need not talk to him again when you want to trade for his stuff. Just take it.
