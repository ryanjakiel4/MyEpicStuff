talk to spider
matthew
tec, ask him what he wants for the power source.
sir, he says he will only relinquish his power gem to a superior being.
What's that supposed to mean?
right now, he views you as a human, but if you preform spectacularly at the game he holds in his hands, then he will give you the power source you need for your spaceship.
so i just need to take his cartridge and beat his score?
yes, sir.
