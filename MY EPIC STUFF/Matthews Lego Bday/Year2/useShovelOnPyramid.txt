Tec, are you sure you sense something in there?
Positive, sir.
Man... well here goes nothing...

Tec! I found something! And it only took a couple hours of digging!
More like a couple seconds, sir.  What you found is a storage car for your train, sir.
What'll that do?
It will hold bricks you dig up for later use.
Awesome!
