Did you open your present? You did! What did ya get?...
What?  Your present was a note telling you that I took the
gift?  No way... it told you to "search the foreign land"...
Well go for it, and good luck!   And if I were you, I would
stop typing commands in the computer, because at this point,
it won't give you any more clues as to where your present is.
