Welcome to your birthday present!  Alas, if you want your real present, its
going to be a lil harder than usual.  In order to succeed in your quest, you
must use a series of commands to guide your person through the world and
eventually reveal the location of your present.  You can say things like,
"go ____", "check ____", "enter ____", "exit ____", "take ____",
"read ____", "use ____ on ____", etc.  You will know there is an error
if a command is typed, but no response is shown.  Errors will be caused by
wrong keywords, misspelled words, etc.  You also have two hints you can use
at any time by typing "hint".

Good Luck.  I suggest you start by getting out of bed...
